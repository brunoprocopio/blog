What I learned as a back-end developer trying to use React from scratch.

<!--more-->

If you want to skip the introduction, you can jump [here](#first-steps).

## What is React and why should I use it?

A common association that I make is that just like when I'm building an API using Node, I usually use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) to make my life easier, to help me build UIs I will use a framework (or library, in that case). That is what React is, a library with all the work done for us developers to worry not about how to handle each component on the page, but with our application design and architecture. In resume, we should worry about how our data will behave, how our objects state will be updated, and not how these informations will be presented to the user.

I asked myself: "Why should I start studying React?". So I came to two main reasons:

1. React is made in JavaScript (and supports TypeScript), which in my case makes total sense considering that I work with JS daily, so I don't need to study a lot of extra steps to start running it, and can focus on my UI and front-end studies.
2. Taking this in account, my next step was the good old Google search "front-end framework js". The main results are:
- React<br/>![Google search of react js](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/react-google-search.png)<br/>![Github repo of react"](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/react-github-repo.png)&nbsp;
- Vue.js<br/>![Google search of vue js](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/vue-google-search.png)<br/>![Github repo of vue"](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/vue-github-repo.png)&nbsp;
- AngularJS<br/>![Google search of angular js](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/angular-google-search.png)<br/>![Github repo of angular"](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/angular-github-repo.png)&nbsp;    
- jQuery<br/>![Google search of jquery](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/jquery-google-search.png)<br/>![Github repo of jquery"](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/jquery-github-repo.png)&nbsp;    

I chose React mainly because of its popularity and number of results on Google, so I think that if I step on any problem, probably I will find answers easily. This reason usually works fine for me, since I like to learn by trying new stuff and solving problems as they appear. If you're looking for a new job or something like that, positions requiring React are more often requested than the other examples.

## About this (and future) articles

I'll try to be as didatic as possible, but I'll assume that you have a basic knowledge on Node and HTML/CSS. For that reason, maybe you'll face some challenge over a concept or something that has not been explored yet, but fell free to contact me on any plataform linked bellow.

## A brief history of React

React was develop by Facebook and officially launched on 2013. The main difference (and core) of this library is to optimize the DOM manipulation, which is a very expensive operation for the browser. The idea is to keep the application state cached and only update the DOM on state changes, and only the objects affected by the update.

The focus of this article is not to explore how the React works in its deepness, but i recommend these two articles for anyone looking for more details.

[Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

[JavaScript's History and How it Led to ReactJS](https://thenewstack.io/javascripts-history-and-how-it-led-to-reactjs/)

## First steps

The only thing that you'll need to start working with React is Node installed on your machine.

Node version: v12.19.1 <br/>
Yarn version: 1.22.5
{:.info}

React has an util named "Create React App", develop and officially maintained by Facebook.

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It's a simple option for starting coding a React app, so I'll use it for my initial studies. The first thing to do is install it. I'll begin doing it with Yarn, and installing it globally on my machine.

``` bash
yarn global add create-react-app
```

Then, I'll create my test application. The command is:

``` bash
create-react-app <app-name> --template typescript
```
app-name: Your application name, here I'll use **my-react-app**. It will also be the name of the new created folder.
{:.info}

By default, the package manager is **yarn**. If you rather use **npm**, you can use the flag -use-npm, like that:<br/>```create-react-app <app-name> --use-npm```
{:.warning}

Also, I'll use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript. This is a new feature on the version 4.0.0, so check if you're using the most recent version if anything breaks.

The project structure is the following:

![Project structure](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/project-structure.png)

- node_modules: Project dependencies. By default, everything that React needs to work is already imported here.
- public: Public static files. Generally, you'll put here common files between the project pages, like when you're following MVC prerrogatives.
  - index.html: Initial application page template.
  - favicon.ico: Icon used by browser tab.<br/>
  ![Icon example](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/icon.png)
  - manifest.json: PWA configuration for sites that can be installed on mobile without any app store. For more information, see here: [Web Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
  - logo*.png: Logos used by manifest.json.
  - robots.txt: Configuration for webcrawlers and search engine robots (like googlebot).
- src: Application source code.
  - App.css and index.css: Style files.
  - logo.svg: The same logo that on /public/, but on svg format.
  - react-app-env.d.ts: Created by create-react-app, adds support to import image files like svg, png, jpg, among others. Do not delete it to avoid further import problems. This file is a type definition for projects created with create-react-app.
  - reportWebVitals.ts: Scripts to report Web Vitals. Web Vitals are an advanced topic that I'm looking to explore in the future, but if you want to understand a little bit about it i recommend this overview: [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).
  - setupTests.ts: Libs for tests.
  - App.test.ts: Tests for App.tsx.
  - App.tsx e index.tsx: Source codes of the app, basically a hello-world. On the next section I'll explain how the application works.
- .gitignore: Files ignored by git.
- package.json: Project configuration, like scripts, dependencies, version and description.
- tsconfig.json: Compilation/Traspilation configuration (for TypeScript).
- yarn.lock: Lockfile generated by yarn (if you're using npm, this file will be actually the package-lock.json).
- README.md: Default React Read-me, explaining how to start, test and build the app.

The next step is to start the development server:

``` bash
yarn start
```

The browser will be opened and you'll see something like this on terminal:

![Terminal](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/terminal.png)

And on browser:

![Browser](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/browser.png)

## How it works

Summing up, when we execute **yarn start** a server is started on port 3000, for our HTML files. By default the file **index.html** will be the root file on the URL **http://localhost:3000**. The *yarn start*, which is actually the command **react-scripts start**, has a *hot reload* feature, so we doesn't have to stop and start the server everytime a file is changed. It's pretty much like [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). Let's take a look on the *index.html*:

index.html
{:.success}

{% highlight html linenos %}
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="Web site created using create-react-app"
    />
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

What we'll look here is the *body*. There is a div with id **root**, where our code will be injected by React. This is done like this:

index.tsx
{:.success}

{% highlight jsx linenos %}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

reportWebVitals();
{% endhighlight %}

The **ReactDOM** is the package that manipulates the page DOM. On the method **render** it renders a React object on the DOM element passed by argument. In this case, what we are saying is that we want the **App** to be rendered on the DOM (HTML) element **root**.

**App** is a function defined on App.tsx, like this:

App.tsx
{:.success}

{% highlight jsx linenos %}
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
{% endhighlight %}

The goal with React is to build my app with **components**. These components are built using declarative code, and they work as an abstraction to the developer so they doesn't have the responsabillity to update how the components state reflects on the UI. React does this for us. 

Now we are going to create our first component, called **Hello World**. This could be anything, a table with the products of our application, a label with a custom text, or anything we might need. Let's update index.html to:

indext.html
{:.success}

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="Web site created using create-react-app"
    />
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="helloWorld"></div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Let's also create a new file called **HelloWorld.tsx**, on src folder.

src/HelloWorld.tsx
{:.success}

{% highlight jsx linenos %}
import React from 'react';

function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello World.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HelloWorld;
{% endhighlight %}

On **index.tsx**, let's use the new component:

index.tsx
{:.success}

{% highlight jsx linenos %}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <HelloWorld />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('helloWorld')
);

{% endhighlight %}

The result is this (on the browser):

![Hello World](/assets/images/posts/2020-11-20/hello-world.png)

Over the next articles, I want to look deeper on key concepts of React as I use them on real-world applications. Some of the topics that I'm thinking of are:

- Component Life Cicle
- Props vs State
- Hooks
- Composition vs Inheritance

If you want more info about Create React App, check the [official guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

Thanks for reading and stay tunned!
