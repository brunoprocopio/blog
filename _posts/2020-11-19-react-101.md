What I learned as a back-end developer trying to use React from scratch.

## What is React and why should I use it?

A common association that I make is that just like when I'm building an API using Node, I usually use Express.js to make my life easier, to help me building UIs I will use a framework (or library, in that case). React is that, a library with all the work done for us developers to worry not about how to handle each component on the page, but in our application design and architecture. In resume, we should worry about how our data will behave, in how our objects state will be updated, and not in how these information will be presented to the user.

I asked myself: "Why should I start studying React?". So I came to two main reasons:

1. React is made in JavaScript (and supports TypeScript), which in my case makes total sense considering that I work with JS daily, so I don't need to study a lot of extra steps to start running it, and can focus on my UI and front-end studies.
2. Taking this in account, my next step was the old and good Google search "front-end framework js". The main results are:
