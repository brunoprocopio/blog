What I learned as a back-end developer trying to use React from scratch.

<!--more-->

## What is React and why should I use it?

A common association that I make is that just like when I'm building an API using Node, I usually use Express.js to make my life easier, to help me building UIs I will use a framework (or library, in that case). React is that, a library with all the work done for us developers to worry not about how to handle each component on the page, but in our application design and architecture. In resume, we should worry about how our data will behave, in how our objects state will be updated, and not in how these information will be presented to the user.
